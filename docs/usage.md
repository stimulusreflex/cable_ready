# Working with CableReady

## ActionCable: The Missing Manual

The author has substantial empathy for any volunteers tasked with documenting abstract framework concepts, including the dozens of people who have contributed in varying degrees to the [Rails Guide for ActionCable](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_cable_overview.html). Still, as a tool for learning how to use ActionCable, it frustrates the reader along several axis and hasn't received the polish other Guides in the Rails framework have benefitted from.

The most unfortunate aspect of the ActionCable guide was the decision to frame the entire mental model around the apparent goal of implementing \[part of\] a chat system. **ActionCable is for building chat systems in the exact same way that Rails is for building blogs.** In fact, this paragraph is very intentionally the only time chat will be mentioned in the entirety of the CableReady documentation. It is realistic to conclude that the near-complete fixation on chat retarded the evolution of real-time interfaces and techniques in Rails by a period measured in years. 🤦‍♀️

`Connection` represents the fully-abstracted raw websocket protocol. Properly configured, one WS connection can support an unbound number of Channels, and it will work hard to keep you connected even if your bandwidth is spotty. Connections are also where most developers implement authentication.

`Channel` is a theme-specific conduit for exchanging messages via the Connection. These conduits are referenced by the developer using either a string or a constant. Channel is designed with a "hub-and-spoke" distribution model in which there is no concept of direct, client-to-client message passing. Implemented as a sibling pair of Ruby and JavaScript classes, Channel provides the flexible conceptual chassis upon which real-time applications can be built in Rails.

`Subscription` is a wire made out of intention, stretched between the firehose "stream" interfaces of the Channel and the densely connected tree your client-side code taps like a spigot. Subscriptions might not be free, but they certainly are quite cheap.

The thing about Channels and Subscriptions is that once you've established them, they only take up as much room as the content that you pass down them. They are a lattice of pneumatic tubes that only exist in the moment they are needed, and not a moment before or after.

To double-murder a metaphor, Channels are to classes what Subscriptions are to instances.

... and now you know how ActionCable works!

## Single Source of Truth

CableReady was created with a deep and informed belief that web[ applications that maintain state on the server are fundamentally easier to design, build and maintain](advocating-for-reactive-rails.md).

However, one of the stranger edge-cases that must be handled in a websockets-enabled world is the potential for a server update to overwrite the value of a text input _while the user is typing into it_. It's a jarring example because it's an end-result that was almost completely impossible to achieve in the Ajax era. Despite our wildest brainstorms, we have yet to identify even a single scenario where a user would consider having their effort undone to be positive.

As a result, CableReady's popular [morph](reference/operations/dom-mutations.md#morph) operation comes pre-installed with a [shouldMorph callback](customization.md#shouldmorph-callbacks) called `verifyNotMutable` that actively prevents the server from overwriting input, textarea and select elements while they are active \(have focus\).

Since forms are rarely designed to be edited by multiple concurrent users 😱 it's unlikely that you'll have to spend time thinking about this issue. If you're one of the lucky ones, you can use CableReady and StimulusReflex to establish a field-level locking system, or at the very least, update CSS or nearby indicators to show that a particular input is locked, contested or potentially out of date.

## Selectors

By default, the `selector` option provided to DOM-mutating operations expects a [CSS selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector) that resolves to **one** single DOM element.

If multiple elements are returned, only the first one is used.

### Operating on multiple elements

Many [DOM Mutation](reference/operations/dom-mutations.md) and [Element Property Mutation](reference/operations/element-mutations.md) operations support a `select_all` option which instructs CableReady to operate on [one or many DOM elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll) returned by the `selector` query.

This technique is quite powerful because it can scoop up elements from multiple locations in the DOM based on their element type, id property, CSS class list or attributes. For example, you could grab every element with an instance of a Stimulus controller called `sushi`:

```ruby
cable_ready.text_content(select_all: true, selector: "[data-controller='sushi']")
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Each element will emit their own "before" and "after" events as part of the same operation.

Any information you change in these events could modify the behavior of the operation for the other elements that were selected. 🐉🐉🐉
{% endhint %}

### xPath

CableReady also supports the use of [XPath](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XPath) query expressions to locate elements based on their location relative to the document root in the DOM hierarchy. 🗺️

To interpret a selector as an XPath query, you need to do two things:

1. Pass `xpath: true` as a parameter argument when enqueueing the operation.
2. Provide an XPath query that matches the desired element, and then ensure its validity until the operation has completed.

Here's a function that can produce an XPath expression for any DOM element:

```javascript
const elementToXPath = element => {
  if (element.id !== '') return "//*[@id='" + element.id + "']"
  if (element === document.body) return '/html/body'

  let ix = 0
  const siblings = element.parentNode.childNodes

  for (var i = 0; i < siblings.length; i++) {
    const sibling = siblings[i]
    if (sibling === element) {
      const computedPath = elementToXPath(element.parentNode)
      const tagName = element.tagName.toLowerCase()
      const ixInc = ix + 1
      return `${computedPath}/${tagName}[${ixInc}]`
    }

    if (sibling.nodeType === 1 && sibling.tagName === element.tagName) ix++
  }
}
```

An XPath-powered operation might look like:

```ruby
cable_ready["stream"]
  .text_content(
    selector: "/html/body/div[3]/div[1]/article[1]/section[5]/ul[1]/li[10]/div[1]/div[2]",
    xpath: true,
    text: "XPath is under-utilized, but beware of side-effects changing your DOM."
  ).broadcast
```

{% hint style="success" %}
You can grab the XPath selector for any element using your browser's Element Inspector. Activate the desired element, right-click and select "Copy", then "Copy full XPath".
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
XPath selectors cannot be used with the `select_all` option, although if this is important to your application, let us know and we'll consider a more flexible implementation.
{% endhint %}

## Life-cycle events

Most CableReady operations emit a DOM [CustomEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent) immediately before an operation is executed, and another immediately after.

They will be emitted from the `selector` element if present, otherwise they will default to `document`.

The event names follow a predictable pattern, as seen with `cable-ready:before-inner-html` and `cable-ready:after-morph`.

These events bubble and can be cancelled.

If jQuery is detected on the current page, jQuery events will be [triggered](https://api.jquery.com/trigger/) immediately after the DOM events. These jQuery events have the same name and `detail` accessors as their DOM event siblings.

A small number of operations, such as [dispatch\_event](reference/operations/event-dispatch.md#dispatch_event) and [console\_log](reference/operations/notifications.md#console_log), do not emit events. It's up to you to make sure that any [custom operations](customization.md#custom-operations) you create raise events, if desired.

{% hint style="info" %}
Don't confuse Life-cycle events emitted by operations with the [dynamically defined events](leveraging-stimulus.md#dispatched-event-listener-controllers) you can send using dispatch\_event operations. The ways you can capture them are the same, but Life-cycle events are part of the CableReady library behaviour whereas dispatched events are ad hoc and not constrained to CableReady operations.
{% endhint %}

### Listening for events

You can create a callback function to handle the life-cycle events CableReady emits, and then register that callback as an [event listener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) without any [special tools](leveraging-stimulus.md).

Create **named functions** \(and avoid anonymous functions\) for your callbacks because it's impossible to [remove](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/removeEventListener) an event listener with an anonymous callback.

```ruby
const afterMorphHandler = event => { console.log(event.detail) }
document.addEventListener('cable-ready:after-morph', afterMorphHandler)
```

Once you have captured an event, you can inspect the `detail` object to access all of the options passed to CableReady when the operation was enqueued.

### Passing extra data to the client

You can pass extra, arbitrary, JSON-compatible data when adding an operation. You can use operations to send extra information such as [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)s and even rendered bits of HTML to the client.

```ruby
cable_ready["biden"].set_cookie(
  cookie: "favorite_food=pasta",
  dog: "Major",
  corn_pop: "bad dude"
).broadcast
```

On the client, you can access all parameters provided to an operation via the `detail` object. Remember, all snake\_case keys will be automatically converted to camelCase:

```javascript
setCookieHandler = event => {
  console.log(event.detail.cornPop)
}
```

In general, it's easier to track related concepts transactionally in one broadcast envelope than it is to assemble data from multiple broadcasts back into a coherent state.

### Modifying operations before they run

Almost all operations emit `cable-ready:before-{operation}` and `cable-ready:after-{operation}` events. If you create an event handler to listen for "before" events, you can access and modify most of the parameters passed when queueing the operation on the server.

Continuing the `set_cookie` example, the event handler is able to intercept the operation mid-flight and change the parameters.

```javascript
setCookieHandler = event => {
  event.detail.cookie = 'favorite_food=yams'
}
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
If your operation is [processing multiple elements](usage.md#operating-on-multiple-elements), each element will emit its own "before" and "after" events. If you change any values in the `event.detail` object, this new value will be picked up by the other elements associated with the current operation that have not been processed, yet.

You could conceivable change a value during the "before" callback, then change it back to the original value during the "after" callback. [This is almost certainly something you don't want to need to be able to do.](https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/#provide-sharp-knives)
{% endhint %}

### Cancelling operations

Almost all operations accept a `cancel` parameter that is designed to be interacted with in a "before" event handler on the client. `cancel` must be `false` or `undefined` when the event handler returns for the operation to run.

```javascript
setCookieHandler = event => {
  event.detail.cancel = true
}
```

Cancelled operations still emit an "after" event, but their primary functionality will not occur.

For example, if you have a long-running Reflex operation, the user might click a cancel button and proceed with their business. When the Reflex finally completes, your event handler can cancel the operation and prevent whatever would have happened.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The server will have no idea that the operation was cancelled on the client. If this would create an inconsistency, you should send a cancel notification to the server, perhaps with a Nothing Reflex.
{% endhint %}

While most developers will never think about or interact with the `cancel` parameter, it's an important tool to have available when building sophisticated client user interfaces.

{% hint style="danger" %}
As with modifying `detail` data, if your operation is [processing multiple elements](usage.md#operating-on-multiple-elements), each element will emit its own "before" and "after" events. You _could_ cancel an operation for a given element and then un-cancel it for later elements.

You _could_ jump out of an airlock into space, too. Don't say we didn't warn you! 👨‍🚀
{% endhint %}

## Focus assignment

The [DOM Mutation](reference/operations/dom-mutations.md) operations accept an optional `focusSelector` parameter that allows you to specify a CSS selector to which element should be active \(receive focus\) after the operation completes.

If `focusSelector` is not specified, the focus will go to the element that was active immediately before the operation was executed.

It is possible to perform an operation that removes the previously active element, leaving the focus in an ambiguous state. It's also possible to use the [set\_focus](reference/operations/browser-manipulations.md#set_focus) operation to manually set the focus at any time.

## ActionCable Connection authentication

Since it's difficult to improve upon perfection, please consult the StimulusReflex documentation section on [authenticating users in ActionCable](https://docs.stimulusreflex.com/authentication).

## Send data to any ActionCable Channel

There are times where it might be useful to send data directly to any clients subscribed to a given Channel stream identifier. It's even compatible with a CableReady performer since the data you send will \(hopefully\) not have a `cableReady` key present.

```ruby
ActionCable.server.broadcast("your-stream-identifier", data)
```

You can see this technique used in "[Verify ActionCable](troubleshooting/#verify-actioncable)".

If you need to send data to a constant-based stream, you just need to break down the fourth wall and construct your identifier manually. Here we will send data to `current_user` using the `UsersChannel`:

```ruby
ActionCable.server.broadcast("users:#{current_user.to_gid_param}", data)
```

`UsersChannel` becomes `users` while ActiveRecord has a `to_gid_param`.

## Poking a subscriber

Sometimes you just need to tell a subscriber that it's time to _do the thing_. You can send a `broadcast` with no operations and still take advantage of the `received` handler:

```ruby
cable_ready["stream"].broadcast
```

```javascript
consumer.subscriptions.create('ChewiesChannel', {
  received (data) {
    console.log('Data was received!')
  }
})
```

## Disconnect a user from their ActionCable Connection

As you can see in the upcoming section on [connection identifiers](identifiers.md#stream-identifiers-from-accessors), ActionCable Connections can designate that they are able to be `identified_by` one or more objects. These can be strings or ActiveRecord model resources. It is **only** using one of these connection identifiers that you can forcibly disconnect a client connection entirely.

Forcing a websocket reconnection is mainly useful for upgrading account privileges after successfully authenticating. You could also disconnect former employees after they've been terminated.

This is going to look a lot like an ActiveRecord finder, but it's a trap! _This is no such thing._ The only thing it can look up are connection identifiers that have already been defined on the Connection class. You need a valid resource reference \(i.e. a user that is actually connected\) to get a match on the ActionCable `remote_connections` mapping. Otherwise, the following will fail silently:

```ruby
ActionCable.server.remote_connections.where(current_user: User.find(1)).disconnect
```

The ActionCable Channel subscriber will immediately start attempting to reconnect to the server, with the usual connection retry rate fall-off curve, just as if you restarted your Puma process.

### Disconnecting when you have multiple identifiers

It's not clear whether this is a bug or a feature, but ActionCable will not allow you to disconnect a user if your Connection has any identifiers which haven't been assigned. Specifically, if you have configured your Connection to be `identified_by` both `current_user` and `session_id`, it will raise an error if your user hasn't authenticated yet. That's no good!

Our suggestion is that you **fix ActionCable** with this initializer, which changes line 6 from `all?` to `any?`

{% code title="config/initializers/action\_cable.rb" %}
```ruby
module ActionCable
  class RemoteConnections
    class RemoteConnection
      def valid_identifiers?(ids)
        keys = ids.keys
        identifiers.any? { |id| keys.include?(id) }
      end
    end
  end
end
```
{% endcode %}

## Integrating with StimulusReflex

StimulusReflex is the sister library to CableReady. It's... really great, actually.

| Library | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- |
| StimulusReflex | Translates user actions into server-side events that change your data, then regenerating your page based on this new data **into an HTML string**. |
| CableReady | Takes the HTML string from StimulusReflex and sends it to the browser before using morphdom to update only the parts of your DOM that changed. |

⬆️ StimulusReflex is for **sending** commands. 📡  
⬇️ CableReady is for **receiving** updates. 👽

{% hint style="info" %}
A Reflex action is a reaction to a user action that changes server-side state and re-renders the current page \(or a subset of the current page\) for that particular user in the background, provided that they are still on the same page.

A CableReady operation is a reaction to some server-side code \(which must be imperatively called\) that makes some change for some set of users in the background.
